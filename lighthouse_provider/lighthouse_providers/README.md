# Lighthouse providers

This library contains the specific lighthouse providers.

It contains a provider for the vive base stations and the lighthouse v2 base stations.

Before adding a provider to the lighthouse provider, you must first add a back end for the platform
you are targeting.

Both provider may also need some values set before they can be used. Check to docs of the specific
provider for it.
