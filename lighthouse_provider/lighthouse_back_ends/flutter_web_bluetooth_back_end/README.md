# Flutter web bluetooth back end

Use the Flutter web bluetooth back end in the lighthouse provider. This back end uses the flutter
web bluetooth library of the same name to provide bluetooth devices on the web.

The web bluetooth standard is not yet supported by each browser. It also differs from other back
ends, in that it needs to pair to a device first.
