It was about time to support Android 14

Changes:
<ul>
<li>Update to support new features from 12, 13, and 14.</li>
<li>Updated dependencies.</li>
<li>Enabled Vive base stations by default..</li>
<li>Updated to material 3 (not all widgets have been updated yet).</li>
<li>Vive base station ids are now bound to the device id instead to the device name.
This way everyone can store whatever id without restrictions, fixing the bug for some people.
This has the effect that all stored ids are now gone (sorry about that).</li>
</ul>
